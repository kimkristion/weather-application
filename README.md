# Weather Forecast Application

## An intuitive weather app that displays current and 5-day forecasts

## Description 

- My motivation for devloping this app was to make it easier to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that my users can plan trips appropriately.
- This applicaion consists of a search bar to input city names to discover the current weather and 5-Day forecast for that city. That city will then be added to a list of cities which users can navigate to find cities they.previously searched
- The bones of my webpage is a display of my knowledge of JavaScript and calling API's for information, specifcally for OpenWeatherMap, and will be eventually used as a resource to reference my abilites.
- While devloping this map I learned how to effectively call API's and contructing API endpoint ULR's for fetching data to display.

## Usage
- Search for Weather using the search bar 
- View the current weather and 5-Day forecast for the city searched as its dynamically displayed on the webpage
- Access previously searched cities by clicking on the list of cities under on the left-hand side of the application
